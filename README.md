# Secure-by-Design Edge Infrastructure Toolkit

## Motivation

The majority of edge and IoT systems deployed today are insecure by construction. Devices are shipped without proper identity models, weak authentication, unsafe update mechanisms, and poorly defined trust boundaries. These weaknesses routinely lead to large-scale vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.

Security is often bolted on after deployment rather than engineered from the foundation.

This project exists to explore and implement what secure edge infrastructure should look like when designed correctly from first principles.

## What this project is trying to solve

* Weak or nonexistent device identity models
* Poor access control and authorization mechanisms
* Insecure update pipelines and lifecycle management
* Lack of zero-trust architecture in edge systems
* Absence of clean reference designs for secure-by-default infrastructure

## Scope

This project focuses on building foundational infrastructure for secure edge systems, including:

* Device identity and authentication primitives
* Fine-grained access control mechanisms
* Secure communication patterns between devices and services
* Secure update and lifecycle management design
* Zero-trust architectural principles for distributed systems
* Threat modeling and explicit security assumptions

The goal is to provide a practical, technically rigorous foundation for building edge systems that can be trusted in real-world deployments.
